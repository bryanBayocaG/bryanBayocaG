**`Student/WebDeveloper`**

I am fascinated by how computer technology has brought changes to our lives that could never have been predicted; witnessing the expansion of computer science allowed me to consider studying software engineering from an early school days, and my enthusiasm has perpetually developed since this time. And also I love exploring new tech stack and frameworks to leveraging them to build cool stuffs.
